# howl-editorconfig

Basic [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) support for all. All keys but `charset` are
supported (Howl always uses UTF-8).

For best results, try with [this Howl PR](https://github.com/howl-editor/howl/pull/514) applied,
which makes the editorconfig files have nice colors.
